# UnderTale-Battle-System
Welcome to my very own unity implementation of the battle system from the hit game UnderTale, made by tony fox.
# How does it work?
it's simple! a bunch of managers for different actions (from ACTing, to FIGHTing, & so on) all being linked together with a singular script, called the "BattleManager", this script is essentially the core script allowing for 99% of what's happening to happen!
