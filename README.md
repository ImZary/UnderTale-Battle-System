# UnderTale-Battle-System
Welcome to my very own unity implementation of the battle system from the hit game UnderTale, made by the world famous composer, tony fox.
# How does it work?
it's simple! a bunch of managers for different actions (from ACTing, to FIGHTing, & so on) all being linked together with a singular script, called the "BattleManager", this script is essentially the core script allowing for 99% of what's happening to happen!
# I want to add an attack, how do I go on doing so?
Simple! the battle system is very flexible, allowing for custom attacks to be added as coroutines! If you wanna add an attack you just code it in, it's that simple!
# Why can't I use ITEM or SPARE?
Sadly, these two features are yet to be fully implemented, the sparing is technically implemented, but it doesn't really end the battle as of right now, I might add them in the near future!
# Don't Forget, Feedback's welcomed! 
if you have anything you think can be improved, share it with me!
